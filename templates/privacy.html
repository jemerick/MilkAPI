<p>Milk API respects your privacy.  Milk API does not use a database at all to store any data.  All settings like your API key, API secret, authentication token, etc are stored in secure cookies on your computer.  Don't want Milk API to have access to this information? Just simply clear your milkapi.com cookies or click <a href="/auth/clear/">here</a> to do so. All API responses, with the exception of those needed during the authentication process (ex. frob and authentication token), are not stored on the server at all. Additionally, Google Analytics is used to track website traffic.</p>

<h1>Website Visitors</h1>
<p>Like most websites, Milk API collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Milk API's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Milk API's visitors use its website. From time to time, Milk API may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Milk API also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Milk API does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h1>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>

<p>Certain visitors to Milk API choose to interact with Milk API in ways that require Milk API to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Milk API gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users to provide an API key and secret. Those who engage in transactions with Milk API are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Milk API collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Milk API. Milk API does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h1>Aggregated Statistics</h1>
<p>Milk API may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Milk API may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Milk API does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h1>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
<p>Milk API discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Milk API's behalf or to provide services available at Milk API's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Milk API's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Milk API will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Milk API discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Milk API believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Milk API, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Milk API and have supplied your email address, Milk API may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Milk API and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Milk API takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h1>Cookies</h1>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Milk API uses cookies to help Milk API identify and track visitors, their usage of the Milk API website, and their website access preferences. Milk API visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Milk API, with the drawback that certain features of Milk API may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy Changes</h1>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Milk API may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Milk API's sole discretion. Milk API encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
